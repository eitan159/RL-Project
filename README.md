We have saved models to load so you can test them.

NOTE: The saved models need to be in the same directory with our code.

How to run our code:

train:

model_name can be: DQN, DDQN, Dueling_DQN, Rainbow_DQN

python PATH/train_DQN_models.py model_name gpu_number

test:

model_name can be: DQN, DDQN, Dueling_DQN, Rainbow_DQN, TD3_FORK

python PATH/test.py model_name gpu_number
